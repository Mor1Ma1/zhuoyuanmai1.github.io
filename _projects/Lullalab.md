#### Announcement

<h4>
<br>
</h4>

Lullalab is a sub-project of "In Loco Parentis" by [Charlotte Jarvis](https://cjarvis.com/), collaborating with [Bethan Hancock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bethan-hancock/), [Jingjing Sun](https://www.instagram.com/jingjingxs), [Jiwon Jang](https://www.instagram.com/jjang.jiwon/), and [Haram Jeong](https://harmangjoa.cargo.site/). 

The project was showcased at the Royal College of Art.

            Lullalab combines scientific research with musical artistry to support artificial embryo growth. By exploring how sound waves affect cellular behavior, gene expression, and DNA sequences, the lab aims to foster growth and differentiation. <br><br>
            Artificial intelligence translates genetic patterns into music, creating lullabies, and studies the effects of specific frequencies on cellular structures. This unique approach offers new insights into the relationship between sound, DNA, and cellular life.<br><br>
            Initially interested in AI’s role in producing artificial life, the focus shifted from designer babies to AI as a caretaker and communicator, exploring how sound can accelerate stem cell growth. <br><br>
            The project envisions the future impact of this process on society and the environment, reflecting on how laboratory environments can incorporate care as technologies take on nurturing roles through lullabies and sound interaction.<br><br>

Project Focus
</h4>

<h4>
<br>
</h4>

The focus of the project expands on real life research undertaken on the effects of sound on growing stem cells. We have speculated that with stem cells being a key part of creating Artificial Embryo Models that hypothetical sound frequency sequences could be designed to encourage the growth of AEM cells.

The species status of classifying AEM is highly debated, however as a group we have decided that there should still be a species of care considered within the process of growing these AEM in laboratories. How do we show elements of care towards something with undefined species status? The environment that AEM's inhabit as they grow is crucial to consider when looking at how we can create a place that is ethical and respectful as a process that involves human materials.

Through the research at RMIT University Australia, there have been studies that prove the effective use of growing bone stem cells through the use of specific sound frequencies. "These sounds are used for treatment in music-therapy for our patients who sign in with bone-bone density issues," said Gemini, Vice-Chancellor's Research fellow at RMIT. "This also extends to overall patient well-being with specific focus-induced music to create a calm safe environment. Staff must also be aware of the tones and their effects to transfer this essence. Our system could show how we can approach new patient care for the body for stem cells, offering speculative outcomes for the future if we invented a world where frequency has power," RMIT team - Sonic aware speculative lab.

Communication is an important topic in this project. In correspondence with the research we have designed a process that explores collaborations between science and technology. Artificial Intelligence is used to envision how hypothetical growth of an Artificial Embryo Model can be translated into sound frequencies that act as a bridge between species, translating sound into frequencies that can be experienced by different life-forms. This all contributes to the LullaLab experience. With a focus on the growth of an AEM, we can translate the hypothetical into the speculative with forms of hypothetical future 'humans' of these AEM via the use of artificial intelligence. LullabLab puts forward discussions of how we can utilise artificial intelligence as a means to explore alternative forms of life, allowing us to explore what alternative forms of life might look like.
