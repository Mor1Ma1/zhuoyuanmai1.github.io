#### Introduction (Quoted from [Peilin Li](https://www.instagram.com/peilin_hh/) & [Peijun Jiang](https://www.instagram.com/jiang_.pj/))

Inspired by a journey of awareness of a pine tree. When i saw it, it stood alone on the vast land, empty, clean, and lonely. The rustling sound of the wind passing through the pine needles brought to my mind a word in traditional Chinese literature “SongTao”. It used to describe the sound of the wind blowing through the pine forest, like the waves of the sea.

The wind passed through its pine needles. I suppose he will miss the sea too.

“I suppose he will miss the sea too” will take the form of a sound interactive theater, which borrows Baudrillard’s “simulation” theory and Heidegger’s explanation of existential loneliness. Trying to create a virtual image of the sea of sound from the memory of the ancient race for a real existence - a lonely pine tree. This project tries to show an eternal and indelible existence and loneliness between heaven and earth through the deconstruction and reconstruction of a pine tree.

The wind travels through the forest and under the tree, become the echo of the tree like the wave of the sea.

In the live sound performance , the winds shall be harnessed as a pivotal element, weaving together a grandiose symphony of waves in an immersive surround sound spectacle. From the the wind through pine needles, a digital visage of a pine tree shall be conjured.
