‘CyBacteria’ stands for cybernetics and bacteria.

As industry grows, the effects of environmental damage are becoming more severe. By adding pollutants to microcolonies in a petri dish or modelling environmental impacts, the link between macro and micro becomes apparent.

The aim of the project is to appeal to the public to reduce pollution by amplifying the microscopic behaviour of bacteria.

            Inspiration
        </h4>
        <p>
            <br>
            To investigate the potential future materials, I conducted a series of biological experiments with a bacterial mixture—SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast).<br>
            During the experiments, I observed that the growth of the bacterium displayed characteristics similar to Earth's ability to maintain equilibrium.<br>
            Hence, I wanted to engage with existing environmental issues by actively influencing the micro-environment and visualize the impact.

    Anthropocene
</h4>

<p>
    <br>
    The term Anthropocene was coined to take into account the impact of the irreversible damage caused by the over-consumption of natural resources.<br><br>
    Anthropocene was popularized in the early 2000s by Paul J. Crutzen.<br><br>
    Scientists noticed that environmental changes were leading the Earth system away from the relative equilibrium it had known since the beginning of the Holocene, 11,700 years ago.

            Cybernetics
        </h4>
        <p>
            <br>
            Cybernetics is a wide-ranging field concerned with circular causality, such as feedback, in regulatory and purposive systems.<br><br>
            One of the most well known definitions is that of Norbert Wiener who characterised cybernetics as concerned with "control and communication in the animal and the machine".<br><br>
            Contemporary cybernetics varies widely in scope and focus, with cyberneticians variously adopting and combining technical, scientific, philosophical, creative, and critical approaches.

            A microbial colony is defined as a visible cluster of microorganisms growing on the surface of or within a solid medium, presumably cultured from a single cell.<br><br>
            Obtaining such genetically identical organisms can be useful.<br><br>
            This is done by spreading organisms on a culture plate and starting a new stock from a single resulting colony.

            Being physically connected allows the colonial organism to distribute nutrients and energy obtained by feeding zooids throughout the colony.<br><br>
            Plus, a biofilm is a colony of microorganisms often comprising several species, with properties and capabilities greater than the aggregate of capabilities of the individual organisms.
